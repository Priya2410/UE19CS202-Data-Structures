<h1> Binary Tree </h1>
<ul>
<li> Non linear DS </li>
<li> Easy to retrieve elements </li>
</ul>
<h4>Binary Tree characteristics and terminologies </h4>
<ul>
<li> A binary tree has atmost 2 child nodes ( ie either 0,1,2 ) children</li>
<li>It is divided into two right sub tree and left subtree </li>
<li>A node with no child is called as the leaf node / external node </li>
<li>A node with children is called internal node </li>
<li> Two nodes emerging from the same parent are called siblings and lie at the same level </li>
<li> Level of a node - is one more than the level of its parent for root the level =0</li>
<li>Height of a node - path from root node to the deepest leaf</li>
<li>Strictly Binary Tree - a tree with either 0 or 2 nodes </li>
<li>Fully Binary Tree - leaf nodes are at the same level Total no. of nodes = 2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^d = 2^(d+1) – 1</li>
<li>Any node nd at level less than d-1 has two children, for any node nd of the tree with a right descendent at
level d, nd must have a left child and every left descendent
of nd is either a leaf at level d or has two children</li>
<li> A binary tree with n nodes has n-1 edges </li>
<li>The total number of nodes in a full binary tree of
depth d is 2^(d+1) – 1</li>
</ul>
