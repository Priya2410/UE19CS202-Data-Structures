CPU Scheduling
CPU picks up the jobs like printing,editing,programming etc from the queue and execute them.
Consider processes P1,P2,P3 ... are picked by the the CPU.
To pick the job from the job pool we use CPU scheduler.
(Process - program under execution)
Different algorithms are present to pick the jobs from the job pool

1) First come first serve
Suppose the jobs come in the order P1,P2,P3 then P1 is executed first and so on.
Ex.Paying fees while standing in a queue,the person coming first is given preference

2)Shortest Job first:
P1 requires 5min
P2 requires 2min
P3 requires 3min
So here P2 is picked first then P3 and then P1

Types
1) Preemptive shortest job 
Suppose P2 is executing already and then P7 comes with process time 1min P7 is given preference and executed first.P2 halts, P7 is executed
2)Non-Preemptive 
Suppose P2 is executing already and then P7 comes with process time 1min.P2 doesnt halt.

3)Longest Job first:
The process with the largest execution time is picked first
Types
1) Preemptive longest job 
Suppose P2 is executing already and then P7 comes with process time >P2  P7 is given preference and executed first.P2 halts, P7 is executed
2)Non-Preemptive 
Suppose P2 is executing already and then P7 comes with process time >P2.P2 doesnt halt.

Round Robin Algorithm:
Suppose we have processes
P1 - 10 min
P2 - 5 min
P3 - 8 min
P4- 2 min
Suppose each of the processes is given a particular CPU time like for 1 min
Like P1 executes for 1min then CPU goes to P2 for 1 min and then P3,P4 for 1 min and so on.

4)Priority
In the Non Preemptive Priority scheduling, The Processes are scheduled according to the priority number assigned to them.
In Preemptive Priority scheduling if another process with less priority comes that is given preference
