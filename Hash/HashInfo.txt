Hashing :

Helps in searching an element in O(constant)
Better than arrays as it takes less space
An hash table maps the key to the values 

Hash function types :
1) Direct Mapping
2) Dividing the key with nearest prime number
3) Truncation
4) Dividing the key with the size of the hash table

Hashing can lead to collisions so we have collision resolution techniques:
1) Open Addressing - chain hashing
2) Closed Addressing - linear,quad,rehash,double

Linear Probing can result in primary clustering where elements are clustered in one particular location

Quadratic Probing leads to secondary clustering where elements are clustered at different locations in small groups

Double Hashing
Hashfunction = nearestprime-key%nearestprime
To prevent collision
j=hashkey1+i*hashkey2 // Initially
j=j+i*hashkey2 // Later

Rehashing
We have to find the load factor 
load factor=total number of records filled/total size of the hashtable
If load factor >=75% we increase the size of the hashtable(double it) and rehash the values.
