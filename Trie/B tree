B tree properties 

1)All leaf nodes are at the same level
2)Min key=ceil((m-1)/2)
3)Max key=m-1
4)Max child=m
5)Min child=ceil(m/2)

Deletion
Leaf nodes
1)If more than min after Deletion then delete normally
2)If less borrow from right/left sibling
3)Right sibling root-----smallest right----node
4)Left sibling root----largest left----node
5)If not delete node and merge right and left node with the parent

Internal node
1)Replace with inorder successor/predecessor
2)If not then merge both and delete node
3)If not borrow from right or left in the same way as leaf nodes
